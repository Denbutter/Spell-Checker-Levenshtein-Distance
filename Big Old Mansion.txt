Everyone avoided the big old mansion. It believed to have spirits and a lot of people say they have heard screams inside it. Well, I have ever been a person that believes in ghosts but I find it very interesting and I have started to interview some people to discover the truth or something that could change my mind.

First, I interviewed my neighbors and I found Mr. Paul, a kind senior who born and grew in that area. He told me that the last owner and his whole family was murdered in that house and that their spirits live there yet.

Afterwards, I talked with another interesting person, Mr. Melissa. She said that the current owners “The Charlies” make up a story that the house is haunted because they want to keeped people far away from the house.

In my opinion both stories are not real because I have never heard or seen anything stranger there, but you never know. In the 21st century, you don’t believe in ghosts, can you?
